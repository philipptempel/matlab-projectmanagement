## Matlab Project Management

This is a simple project management "plugin" for MATLAB that will enhance your project experience to new levels. Using matlab-projectmanagement you can

* Manage different folders as project
* Easily switch between them
* Easily add, update, or delete projects

## Install

That's quite simple: Copy the content of this repository to any location of your desire (let's assuming you're copying the files to ```matlabroot/prjmgmt```).

Then, all you need to do is add said folder to MATLAB's search paths and run the script from MATLAB's command window like so

```bash
>> prjmgmt
```

A window will pop open with some (self explanatory) buttons that you can click and perform certain actions on your project.
